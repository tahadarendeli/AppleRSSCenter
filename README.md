# AppleRSSCenter

In this application you can find RSS feeds which are provided by Apple. This application demonstrates top 25 applications, songs, albums, books, movies and other related areas. You have option the filtre results by a particular genre. This demo application coded for CS 392 class project which is currently teaching in Ozyegin University. 

To run this project in xcode you hsould run ClassProject.xcworkspace file. In this project I used Alamofire, Alamofire RSSParser and Kingfisher libraries. Alamofire is good for pulling requests and parsing with Alamofire RSSParser is very useful. I used kingfisher for downloading images from url and caching them. I need to add that i modified Alamofire RSSParser library for Apple's RSS service. Feel free to use any part of this project.
